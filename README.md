# Object detection using TensorFlow JS

A real time object detection model in your browser using TensorFlow JS.

Wait for the model to load before clicking the button to enable the webcam - at which point it will become visible to use.

Hold some objects up close to your webcam to get a real-time classification! When ready click "enable webcam" below and accept access to the webcam when the browser asks (check the top left of your window)
